## US Births in 1978

Here is an interesting plot showing the number of live births in the United
States each day of 1978.  

```{r}
gf_point(births ~ date, data = Births1978)
```

 1. What patterns do you notice in this data?
 
 2. What possible explanations could there be for these patterns?
 
 3. What explanations might students give that indicate they are misunderstanding the plot?

## How do we make this plot?

```{r, echo = FALSE}
gf_point(births ~ date, data = Births1978)
```

We are going to use this plot

  * to learn how to create plots using the `ggformula` package 
  
  * to begin thinking about designing, describing, and interpreting plots more generally

### Two important questions

To get R (or any software) to create this plot (or do anything else, really),
there are two important questions you must be able to answer. 
Before continuing, see if you can figure out **what two questions we have in mind**.

### The Questions

To get R (or any software) to create a plot, there are two
important questions you must be able to answer:

#### 1. What do you want the computer to do?
  
#### 2. What must the computer know in order to do that?

### Answers to the questions

To make this plot, the answers to our questions are 

#### 1. What do you want the computer to do?

**A.** Make a scatter plot (i.e., a **plot** consisting of **points**)
  
#### 2. What must the computer know in order to do that?

**A.** The data used for the plot:

  * The variable to be plotted along the $y$ axis.
  * The variable to be plotted along the $x$ axis.
  * The data set that contains the variables.
      
We just need to learn how to tell R these answers.     


## Plotting with Formulas

### The Formula Template

We will provide answers to our two questions by filling in
the boxes of this important template:

<center>
<h2><strong><span class="invboxed">goal</span> ( <span class="invboxed">yyy</span> ~ <span class="invboxed">xxx</span> , data = <span class="invboxed">mydata</span> )</strong> 
</h2></center>

&nbsp;

We just need to identify which portions of our answers go into which boxes.

### The Name of the Game

It is useful to provide names for the boxes:

<center>
<h2><strong><span class="boxed">goal</span> ( <span class="boxed">&nbsp;y&nbsp;</span> ~ <span class="boxed">&nbsp;x&nbsp;</span> , data = <span class="boxed">mydata</span> , ...)</strong> 
</h2></center>
&nbsp;

These names can help us remember which things go where.
(The `...` indicates that there are some additional arguments we will add
eventually.)

<!-- #### Other versions -->

<!-- Sometimes we will add or subtract a bit from our formula. -->
<!-- Here are some other forms we will eventually see. -->

<!-- ```{r eval=FALSE, echo = TRUE} -->
<!-- # simpler version -->
<!-- goal( ~ x, data = mydata )           -->
<!-- # fancier version -->
<!-- goal( y ~ x | z , data = mydata )    -->
<!-- # unified version -->
<!-- goal( formula , data = mydata )      -->
<!-- ``` -->

### 2 Questions and the Formula Template


&nbsp;
<center>
<h2><strong><span class="boxed">goal</span> ( <span class="boxed">&nbsp;y&nbsp;</span> ~ <span class="boxed">&nbsp;x&nbsp;</span> , data = <span class="boxed">mydata</span> )</strong> 
</h2></center>
 
&nbsp;


#### Q. What do you want R to do?  A. goal

 * This determines the function to use.
 
 * For a plot, the function will describe what sorts of marks to draw (points, in our example).
 
    * other possibilities include lines, boxplots, etc, etc.

#### Q. What must R know to do that?  A. arguments 

 * This determines the inputs to the function.
 * For a plot, we must identify the variables and the data frame that contains them.
 
## Assembling the pieces

#### Template

&nbsp;
<center>
<h2><strong><span class="boxed">goal</span> ( <span class="boxed">&nbsp;y&nbsp;</span> ~ <span class="boxed">&nbsp;x&nbsp;</span> , data = <span class="boxed">mydata</span> )</strong> 
</h2></center>
 
&nbsp;

#### Pieces

<table align = "center" >
<tr>
  <th> box </th>
  <th> fill in with </th>
  <th> purpose </th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td> `goal` </td>
  <td> `gf_point` </td>
  <td> plot some points </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td> `y` </td>
  <td> `births` </td>
  <td> y-axis variable</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td> `x` </td>
  <td> `date` </td>
  <td> x-axis variable </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td> `mydata` </td>
  <td> `Births1978`</td>
  <td> name of data set </td>
</tr>
</table>

#### Exercise

Put each piece in its place in the template below and then run the code
to create the plot. 

```{r, gf_point, echo = TRUE, exercise = TRUE}
goal(y ~ x, data = mydata)
```

<div id="gf_point-hint">
If you get an "object not found" or "could not find function" error message,
that indicates that you have not correctly filled in one of the four boxes from
the template.  

Note: R is case sensitive, so watch your capitalization.
</div>
  
For the record, here are the first few rows of `Births1978`.
  
```{r}
Births1978 %>% head(3) %>% select(births, date, day_of_year, wday)
```

## Formulas

The most distinctive feature of `ggformula` plots is the use of formulas to 
describe the positional information of a plot.
Formulas in R always involve the tilde character, which is easy to overlook.
It looks like this:  

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/tilde.png")
```

The position of ![](images/tilde-small.png) on the keyboard varies from brand to brand. On Apple keyboards, it's here.

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "40%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/keyboard-tilde.png")
```

#### Exercise

Find the ![](images/tilde-small.png) on your keyboard and type `births ~ date` in 
the code block.  That's the formula we need for our plot.

```{r type-tilde, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines = 2}

```

```{r type-tilde-check, echo = FALSE}
set_success_message("Good. That's all this exercise was about: typing a formula.")
t1 <- find_call("whatever ~ whatever", message = "do you have a tilde (~)?  Does your formula have two sides?")
t2 <- find_call("births ~ date", message = "you need to have the y-axis variable on the left and the x-axis variable on the right")

USER_CODE %>% t1 %>% t2 
```

## Using formulas to describe plots

Most `gf_` functions take a formula that describes the positional
attributes of the plot.  Using one of these functions with no arguments
will show you the "shape" of the formula it requires.

### Exercise
Run this code to see the formula shape for `gf_point()`.

```{r, gf-shape, exercise = TRUE}
gf_point()
```

You should see that `gf_point()`'s formula has the shape `y ~ x`, 
so the $y$-variable name goes before the tilde and the $x$-variable name goes
after.  (Think:  "y depends on x".  Also note that the $y$-axis label appears
farther left than the $x$-axis label.)


### Exercise

Change `date` to `day_of_year` and see how the plot changes.
(If you do this on a separate line, you will see both plots at once.)

```{r, gf_point-day_of_year, echo = TRUE, exercise = TRUE}
gf_point(births ~ date, data = Births1978)
```

#### Bonus Exercise (Optional)

Reverse the roles of the variables -- changing `births ~ date` to 
`date ~ births` -- to see how the plot changes.


## Changing things up -- different types of plots

Our plots have points because we have used `gf_point()`.  But there are 
many other `gf_` functions that create different types of plots.

#### Exercise

Experiment with some other plot types by changing `gf_point()` to 
one of the following:

  * `gf_line()`: connect the dots
  * `gf_lm()`: a regression line (lm = linear model)
  * `gf_smooth()`: smoothed version of `gf_line()` (LOESS or lm)
  * `gf_spline()`: another type of smoother (using splines)

Which type of plot reveals **exceptional cases** the best?  What are those exceptional
cases?

```{r, gf_point-layer, echo = TRUE, exercise = TRUE}
gf_point(births ~ date, data = Births1978)
```

## Setting and Mapping attributes

The births data in 1978 contains two clear "waves" of dots.  One conjecture
is that these are weekdays and weekends.  We can test this conjecture
by putting different days in different colors.

In the lingo of `ggformula`, we need to **map** color to the variable `wday`.
**Mapping** and **setting** attributes are different in an important way.

 * `color = "navy"` **sets** the color to "navy".  All the dots will be navy.
 
 *  `color = ~ wday` **maps** color to `wday`. This means that the color will 
 depend on the values of `wday`. A legend (aka, a guide) will be 
 automatically included to show us which days are which.
 
#### Exercise

  1. Change the color argument so that it maps to `wday`.
  Don't forget the tilde (`~`).
  
  2. Try some other plot types: `gf_line()`, `gf_smooth()`, etc.  Which do you
  like best? Why?
  
  
```{r, color-mapping, exercise = TRUE}
gf_point(births ~ date, data = Births1978, color = "navy")
```

```{r color-mapping-quiz}
quiz(
  question(
    "Does it appear that the conjecture about weekends is generally correct?",
    answer("yes", correct = TRUE),
    answer("no")
  ),
  question(
    "What happens if you omit the `~` before `~wday`?",
    answer("It works just the same.  The tilde isn't required."),
    answer("All the dots are the same color."),
    answer("There is an error message: 'wday' not found.", correct = TRUE),
    answer("The entire tutorial freezes up and you have to hit \"Restart\" to continue.")
  )
)
```

### What attributes are available?

You can learn about the attributes available for a given layer using the 
"quick help" for a layer function.  You can find out more by reading the help file
produced with `?`.

```{r, quick-help, exercise = TRUE}
# "quick help" for gf_point()
gf_point()
```

#### What are the color names?  
  
Curious to know all the available color names? Run this code.

```{r, colors, exercise = TRUE}
colors()
```

## Facets

### Looking at 20 years of data

If we want to look at all 20 years of birth data (in the `Births` data set), 
overlaying the data is likely to put too much information in too little space
and make it hard to tell which data is from which year.  (Deciphering 20 colors
or 20 shapes can be hard, too.) 

Instead, lets but each year in separate **facet** or sub-plot. Facets are better
than 20 separate plots because the coordinate systems are shared across the
facets which saves space and makes comparisons across facets easier.

The simplest way is use facets is to add a vertical bar `|` to
our formula followed by the faceting variable, in this case `year`.


```{r, births-facets, exercise = TRUE, fig.height = 6}
gf_point(births ~ day_of_year | year, data = Births, 
         size = 0.5)
```

#### Exercise

Edit the plot above to do the following:

  1. map color to `wday`
  2. change from points to lines or one of the smoothers

What do you notice as you look at the births data over these 20 years?

```{r, births-facets-ex1, exercise = TRUE, fig.height = 6}
gf_point(births ~ day_of_year | year, data = Births, 
         size = 0.5)
```


### Facet Grids and Facet Wraps

The faceting we did on the previous page is called facet wrapping.  If the facets
don't fit nicely in one row, the facets continue onto additional rows.

A facet grid uses rows, or columns, or both in a fixed way.

```{r, facet-grid, exercise = TRUE, fig.height = 9}
gf_point(births ~ day_of_year | year ~ wday, data = Births, 
         size = 0.5)
```

Facet grids accept one of three possible shapes

  * `y ~ x` (facets along both axes)
  * ` ~ x`  (facets only along x-axis)
  * `y ~ .` (facets only along y-axis; notice the important dot in this one)  


## Numerical Summaries

One of the powerful features of the formula template is that it can be used for other 
things in addition to plotting.  Fore example, numerical summaries can be created using
the same formula template.

#### Exercise

Change mean to one or more of the following: `median`, `sd`, `max`, `min`.
What happens if you omit `mean` and don't replace it with anything?

```{r, numerical, exercise = TRUE}
df_stats(births ~ wday, data = Births1978, mean)
```


## More Practice 

Time to explore on your own.  Here are some data sets you can use.

  * `Births1969` through `Births1988` contain birth data for individual years.
  * `HELPrct` has data from a study of people addicted to alcohol, cocaine, or heroine
  * `KidsFeet` has information about some kids' feet.
  * `NHANES` has lots of physiologic and other measurements from 10,000
  subjects in the National Health and Nutrition Evaluation Survey.
  
To find out more about the data sets use `?HELPrct`, `?KidsFeet`, or  `?NHANES`.
To see the first few rows of the `KidsFeet` data, you can use `head(KidsFeet)`.

To get a list of functions available in `ggformula`, run this code chunk.

```{r, apropos, exercise = TRUE}
# list all functions starting gf_
apropos("gf_")
```

#### Exercise.

Make some plots to explore one or more of these data sets.

 * Experiment with different types of plots.
 * Use mapping and/or facets to reveal groups.
 * You can put more than one plot in a code chunk, but we've provided two chunks
 in case you want to separate your work that way.  Use one chunk for experimenting
 and copy and paste your favorites to the other chunk if you like.

```{r, explore, exercise = TRUE}
gf_point(length ~ width, data = KidsFeet)
head(KidsFeet)
?KidsFeet
```

```{r, explore-more, exercise = TRUE}

```

## Where do we go from here?

If you are fussy about your plots, you may be wondering how to have more control over 
things like:

  * the colors, shapes, and sizes chosen when mapping attributes
  * labeling, including titles and axis labels
  * fonts, colors, and sizes of text
  * color of plot elements like background, gridlines, facet labels, etc.
  
As you can imagine, all of these things can be adjusted pretty much however you like.
But we'll save that for a separate tutorial on customizing your plots.
